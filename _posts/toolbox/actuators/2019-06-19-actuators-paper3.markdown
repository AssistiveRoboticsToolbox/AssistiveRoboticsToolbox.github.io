Abstract—The usage of hydraulics in biorobotic applications has increased in recent years, due to the advantage of high force to weight ratios, energy and power density. A hydraulically actuated artificial muscle, using the working principle of the pneumatic McKibben muscle, can be used with the advantage of safety and compliance to human biomechanics compared to rigid exoskeletons. The development of the in-house lightweight 2 kg hydraulic driving system and artificial muscle (1” D, 8”/10” L) is documented, with experimentation conducted so far at pressures of up to 140 psi, capable of lifting a weight of up to 82.2 lbs. Informal testing to confirm the durability of the fully pressurized muscle is used, running over a longer muscle with a 9110 lb vehicle without actuator failure. Further work such as optimizing the muscle, optimizing the system, and designing an end effector for a soft robot for elbow flexion assistance is discussed.
