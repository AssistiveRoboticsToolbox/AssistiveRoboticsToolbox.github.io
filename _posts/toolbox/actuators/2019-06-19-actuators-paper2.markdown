Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for
myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication,
and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited
by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and
single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we
propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial
muscles.
