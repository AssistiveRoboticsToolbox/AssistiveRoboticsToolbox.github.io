In-shoe pressure measurement devices are commonly used in both research and clinical settings to quantify contact area and pressure on the plantar surface of the foot when wearing a shoe. The devices enable the measurement and comparison of pressure in cases of diseases such as diabetes, and the evaluation of footwear or orthotics designed to modify plantar pressures. Various devices are available, which differ in size, sensor number, sensor type and therefore their response to loading and their accuracy. The strengths and weaknesses of each system in terms of validity and repeatability influence the appropriateness of each device for specific tasks in both clinical and research settings.
