We presents a prototype design for a soft, backdrivable, cable-driven, hip exoskeleton for gait assistance in elderly persons. This design seeks to instantiate three paradigm shifts in exoskeleton robotics: 1) a shift from passive, rigid, and task-space oriented structures to a more compliant, active, joint-spaced design by utilizing cable-driven torque transmission and non-elastic soft straps; 2) a shift from heavy, resistive, and loud actuation to more transparent, backdrivable, and lightweight actuation by utilizing high torque density motors and low gear ratios; 3) a shift from slow and unintelligent control to responsive and intuitive control by utilizing intelligent gait detection and an  assistive torque control strategy coupled with intelligent actuation.
